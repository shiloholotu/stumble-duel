Made in GameMaker Studio, Stumble Duel is a physics-based fighting game where players rapidly move back and forth to stay balanced and knock each other over! 
**Be careful!** You have to keep your center of balance supported. Make sure to move in the direction that offsets any leaning.

Every round you win, you grow bigger (and become harder to balance). First to win 3 rounds takes the crown! Can be played Singleplayer or Local-Multiplayer
